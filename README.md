*bdaht* is a repository that houses a collection of dot (hidden profile and config) files I've used in my *NIX development environments.  Feel free to use these at your discrection.

The name of this repo comes from [bdaht](http://wild-n-out.wikia.com/wiki/B-Daht), an American comedian and radio host, best known for creating "The Freestyle Funny Comedy Show".  B Daht currently has his own morning show on 102 Jamz in Greensboro, NC, a radio station I often listen to in the morning.
